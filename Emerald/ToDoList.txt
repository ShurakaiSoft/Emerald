The ToDo list.


TextUI
* Create a more responsive UI by not sleeping while waiting for an answer
* Add options for sorting and displaying answers 

Dictionary
* Modify it to allow multiple readers but one writer.

Controller
* Find a more elegant solution to the Solver deadlock problem.

Solver
* Should probably create its own thread for run() rather than depending on
some other class to create the thread. Might keep it more self contained.

Unsolved
* Class needs a clean up and redesign to simplify its interface.
* Consider removing Runnable interface since it's not currently used that way.
* Use cache to speed up answers to substring queries, and record substrings in
cache for later use.

Extensions
* Add an Android GUI.
* Add fixed characters
* Add random characters
