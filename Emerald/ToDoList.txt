The ToDo list.


* Optimise dictionary search with a set of sorted arrays of strings that are
the same length.

* Allow the TextUI to be interactive and non-interactive so that it could be 
used in scripts.

* Enhance the Controller to be able to handle multiple asynchronous requests.

* Enhance the Solver to solve multiple problems asynchronously by using threads
or perhaps a thread pool.  

* Add a gui user interface.
