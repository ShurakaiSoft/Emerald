The ToDo list.


* Allow the TextUI to be interactive and non-interactive so that it could be 
used in scripts.

* Enhance the Controller to be able to handle multiple asynchronous requests.

* Enhance the Solver to solve multiple problems asynchronously by using threads
or perhaps a thread pool.  

* Add a gui user interface.

* Modify the permutation list to only add letter sets that contain at least one
vowel.

* Move the vowel checker from the Controller class to the Dictionary class.
