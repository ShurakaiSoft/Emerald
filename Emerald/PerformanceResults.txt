This file documents my finding on some rough performance testing.

For consistency all searches are performed with the string "qwertyuiop" on the
same hardware under similar load. These figures are a rough guide only.

Version 2.1
Uses hash table based on word length and a binary search on that subset of
words in the dictionary.
Time: around 1 minute and 5 seconds.

Version 1
Used a linear search of the dictionary file against a complete set of
permutations if the search string and all substrings.
Time = around 52 minutes.
